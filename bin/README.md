# Web Spring (Assignment)

## Introduction

This document tells you what you need, and what you must do, to submit your solution for the Web Spring programming assignment. Read it carefully before you begin work on the solution. This document contains strict guidelines about the way the work is to be performed. These guidelines ensure consistency and fairness.

This programming assignment aims to verify the candidate's ability to write a web-based application program using Java and Spring Framework. The application requires the following:

- Must use Spring Framework to:
	- setup and configure applications (Java-based configuration is preferred)
	- test Spring-based applications
- Must use JPA/Hibernate with Spring for object-relational mapping (ORM) appropriately
	- Native SQL and JDBC can be used where appropriate
	- Spring Data JPA can also be used
- Must use transactions (i.e. all or nothing) where applicable
- Must use Spring Web/MVC
	- Must use MockMvc for testing controllers
- Must use proper HTTP headers to allow browsers to cache content where applicable
- Must use Spring Security to facilitate authentication and authorization
- The stories have been identified, split, and sorted, based on business value, risk, size, and cost. You *must* complete one story first, before moving to the next one. To complete a story, you *must* tag it in the code repository, have an assessor check it.

This document is divided into the following sections:

- [Application Overview](src/site/markdown/application-overview.md)
- [Code Style](src/site/markdown/code-style.md)
- [O&B Java Web App Development Guidelines](src/site/markdown/web-development-guidelines.md)
- [Deliverables](src/site/markdown/deliverables.md)
- [Marking](src/site/markdown/marking.md)

## Important Note About Automatic Failure

*Where this document uses the word "must" an absolute requirement is being described. If you fail to adhere to such a requirement, your assignment will be failed automatically, and without further evaluation. It is therefore imperative that you pay close attention to any statement using the word "must" in this document.*
