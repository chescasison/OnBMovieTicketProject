# Deliverables

## Target Platform and Execution

The submitted assignment *must* use the dependencies, libraries, and versions specified in the [POM](../../../pom.xml). No additional dependencies shall be added, unless otherwise approved.

While no additional test/compile/runtime dependencies can be added, you *can* add build-time plugins.

## Submissions

All source code *must* be in a **private** Git repository and shared only to assessors.

To start, fork this repository.

Upon submission, please notify the assessor(s) and inform them of the tagged version that is for assessment. For uniformity, the tag name *must* be `v0.x.y` where `x` is the user story number, and `y` is a sequence that starts with `0`. For example, the first submission for user story 1 would be tagged as `v0.1.0` and subsequent changes/fixes would be tagged as `v0.1.1` and so on. For user story 2, it would be tagged as `v0.2.0` and so on.
